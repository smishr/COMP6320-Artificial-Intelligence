1,1,3,0,7
1,2,4,2,7
1,3,1,0,1
I have been able to implement the constraints and write them to the file but could not run the minzinc model from within the Python file. 
Therefore I am trying to explain my working and understanding here. Take for instance the above three lines. Truck 1 delivers to customer
3,4,1 in that order. In my code, I am getting the permutation of the order i.e. (1,3,4), (3,1,4), (1,4,3), (4,1,3) ... etc and then send-ing
that particular truck in theat order and trying to check if the total cost decreases or not. If it does then that means the order for that
truck is better than then one started with and this can be saved.
